# ogma

A featureful terminal speed-reading tool based on [speedread](https://github.com/pasky/speedread).

Displays text one word at a time using RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation) aligned on optimal reading points, allowing you to read much faster than normal.

## Usage

```shell
ogma -w 500 tea.txt
```

## Controls

- `[` - slow down by 10%
- `]` - speed up by 10%
- `b` - toggle bionic reading mode
- `m` - toggle multiword mode
- space - pause (and show the last two lines)

## Options

- `-w WORDS_PER_MINUTE` - Set reading speed (default: 250)
- `-r RESUME_POINT` - Resume from a specific word position
- `-m` - Join short adjacent words together
- `-b` - Enable bionic reading (make the prefix of a word bold and the rest normal weight)
